# Intro

I am a Full Stack and Salesforce developer. I like to develop projects with good quality and that have a great and positive impact.

Between 2019-2020 I had the opportunity to work on plant simulation projects for robots pre sales.

Before that, I worked with hardware technical support.

I like Open Source projects as well as to learn new software developement technologies.

# Currently

Currently I'm woking as a Salesforce Software Engineer at a consulting company. My primary focus is on improving user experiences using the Salesforce CRM to a vast user base of clients.
